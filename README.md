Title: First ATM

Description:
This is an ATM app that allows you to deposit or get cash back.
Once you have money in the account, the line that shows your total turns green.
If an attempt to withdraw more funs than you have, an alert displays letting you know to request less than your balance.
Improvements to make would include storing this information for later access, having a "prettier" UI, and being able to use numbers that are floats up to two decimals rather than strictly integers.

How to use:
To open this project, download all files and launch with a local server or load onto a coding sandbox.
Please note: This project is part of an assignment for a course with MIT and is not an actual bank.
